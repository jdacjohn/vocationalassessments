					 <dl> 
						<dt>Identification of Questions To Be Answered During
						  Testing: </dt> 
						<dd>Each referring individual will present a unique set of
						  referral questions for his/her evaluees. Based on these referral questions the
						  evaluation plan will address what assessment instruments would best answer the
						  referral sources needs. </dd> 
						<dt>Length Of Evaluations:</dt> 
						<dd> Based upon the information needed by the referral
						  source, the evaluee will be tested in a one-day, three-day, thirty-hour, or a
						  sixty-hour vocational evaluation. Persons who require only a minimal assessment
						  will be accomplished in the one-day vocational assessment. 
						  <dl> 
							 <dt>What the Three (3) Day vocational Assessment
								includes:</dt> 
							 <dd> Interview, vocational history, academic testing
								(reading, spelling, math), interest test, nonverbal reasoning test, motor
								skills assessment, a transferable skills analysis, endurance for an eight-hour
								day, and assessment of interview abilities. Aptitude testing in a variety of
								interest areas. VIP's complete work sample system is utilized to gather
								information about the students ability to work. Aptitude testing in appropriate
								areas; (I.E. mechanical and clerical). Vocational areas are suggested for
								training or on the job placement. Behavioral observations are made regarding
								attitudes, motivation, and worker characteristics. Specific jobs are
								recommended along with recommendations to eliminate barriers to same. A
								comprehensive staffing is included at the school in either the I.E.P. or with
								the student and referring staff members.</dd> 
						  </dl></dd> 
						<dt>Use of Adaptive Equipment during Evaluation:</dt> 
						<dd> Because of the unique nature of each individual, the
						  vocational evaluation will use various adaptive equipment as well as
						  modifications to standardized testing to best serve each evaluee. Physical as
						  well as mental limitations will be compensated for in the testing. The
						  philosophy of the evaluation team is that each person with a disability is
						  unique and that the Americans With Disabilities Act now will require reasonable
						  accommodations and that this process should begin within the vocational
						  evaluation laboratory setting.</dd> 
						<dt>Specific Assessment Instruments and Techniques:</dt> 
						<dd>The assessment instruments and techniques will include,
						  but not be limited to: 
						  <dl> 
							 <dt>Psychometrics:</dt> 
							 <dd>Various standardized academic tests (reading, math,
								spelling, and verbal &amp; written vocabulary), non-verbal tests, and locally
								normed assessment instruments. Standardized assessments will include: 
								<ul> 
								  <li>An IQ test, either: RAVENS, BETA II or OTIS.</li>
								  <li>The WIDE RANGE ACHIEVEMENT TEST </li> 
								  <li>The WIDE RANGE VOCABULARY TEST </li> 
								  <li>An interest test, either: GORDON, BECKER, or
									 VALPAR GOE. </li> 
								  <li>A sample job application</li> 
								</ul></dd> 
							 <dt>Work Samples:</dt> 
							 <dd>Standardized commercial work sample systems as well
								as locally developed and normed work samples. The work samples will assess: 
								<ul> 
								  <li></li> 
								  <li> Realistic worker skills and traits associated
									 with actual jobs that are available in the local economy. </li> 
								  <li> Ability to follow standardized instructions
									 while working with tools and devices common to the type of work being
									 assessed.</li> 
								</ul> 
								<p>Each work sample will have:</p> 
								<ol> 
								  <li></li> 
								  <li>An examiners manual which will relate the work
									 sample to a competitive job or group of jobs. </li> 
								  <li>The prerequisites to attempting the work sample.
									 </li> 
								  <li>The purpose of the work sample clearly identified
									 to the evaluee. </li> 
								  <li>Standardized equipment and materials identified
									 for the evaluee and the examiner. </li> 
								  <li>The preparation required for using the work
									 sample for testing. </li> 
								  <li>Standardized instructions to the evaluee. </li> 
								  <li>Instructions to the examiner for the procedures
									 of testing, timing, and scoring. </li> 
								  <li>Instructions for interpreting the scores
									 achieved.</li> 
								</ol></dd> 
							 <dt>Transferable Skills Analysis: </dt> 
							 <dd>The working history of the evaluee is taken and a
								search is conducted of a computer data base containing over 29,000 job titles.
								The requisite skills of the previous jobs are composited to determine residual
								capacities. Then the limitations are included in the job search. The best
								matches that are available in the area are retained. When coupled with an
								academic assessment and a valid work history this tool makes for an especially
								useful instrument.</dd> 
							 <dt>Simulated Job Situations:</dt> 
							 <dd>The evaluee is assessed in a situation that resembles
								or is identical to the actual job environment in which the tested job is
								accomplished. All factors assessed should closely resemble the actual job
								including; physical factors, quality, quantity, and criteria for completion of
								the same task as would be found on an actual job.</dd> 
							 <dt>Job Exploration: </dt> 
							 <dd>Use of numerous exploration activities using The
								Dictionary of Occupational Titles, Occupational Outlook Handbook, and Various
								exploration activities.</dd> 
							 <dt>On the Job Evaluation: </dt> 
							 <dd>On an actual job site the evaluee is assessed to
								determine his/her suitability for a particular job or type of job. They are
								assessed as to his/her ability to follow supervision, work safely, ability to
								work, ability to arrive and use transportation services, and ability to work in
								a competitive situation.</dd> 
							 <dt>Interviews &amp; Behavioral Observations: </dt> 
							 <dd>During the course of the vocational evaluation a
								vocational interview is conducted on each person. This interview includes (but
								is not limited to); personal history, social interactions, physical history,
								educational history, employment history, and general information relating to
								his/her specific disability and how it relates to his/her vocational goals.
								Additionally, while working on the various work samples and devices each
								evaluee is observed as to how his/her behaviors would be accepted by a possible
								employer and this information is recorded.</dd> 
							 <dt>Other Evaluations or Assessments as needed: </dt> 
							 <dd>The staff of the VIP customize an evaluation which
								will meet your needs. If sufficient numbers of persons are to be tested the
								evaluation can be brought to another city if suitable facilities are
								provided.</dd> 
							 <dt>Staff Qualifications: </dt> 
							 <dd>The vocational evaluation will be supervised by a
								Certified Vocational Evaluator and Certified Rehabilitation Counselor, who has
								been trained at the Masters Level in vocational evaluation and general
								rehabilitation. Staff members are fluent in American Sign Language (ASL) The
								technicians are trained and supervised in administration of work samples and
								other assessment devices. When referral is needed an outside agency, it is made
								to ensure that the best information available is used in making a vocational
								decision.</dd>
