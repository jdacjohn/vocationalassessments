					 <ol> 
						<li> Attendance - A daily log is kept on each person who is
						  attending the program to verify consistency of attendance. </li> 
						<li> Punctuality - Arrival on time in the morning, after
						  scheduled breaks, and after lunch is observed. </li> 
						<li> Hygiene - Grooming, personal cleanliness, proper attire
						  for the vocational area under consideration are monitored each day to identify
						  any deficits and barriers to employment. </li>

						  others, as well as to supervisory personnel are recorded. </li> 
						<li> Teamwork - Ability to work as a member of a team is
						  observed and recorded during the period of observation. Additionally the
						  evaluee is asked to complete a vocational survey which helps to assess his/her
						  ability to properly respond to various peer interactions.</li> 
						<li>. Cooperation - The evaluation team observes the level of
						  cooperation with peers in team related tasks and ability to cooperate with
						  supervisors. </li>

						<li> Ability To Accept Supervision - While undergoing the
						  vocational evaluation the evaluee is placed in numerous working situations as
						  well as while undergoing standardized testing. The ability to respond in an
						  appropriate fashion is objectively and subjectively recorded. </li> 
						<li> Effort, Initiative, Perseverance - Standardized
						  vocational work sample and paper/pencil testing is utilized and evaluees are
						  observed in the performance and speed on vocational testing. At the approximate
						  middle of the vocational evaluation the level of these traits is discussed with
						  the evaluee and he/she is presented with an opportunity to improve his/her
						  performance. </li> 
						<li> Dependability And Emotional Stability - When given a
						  task, can the evaluee be relied upon to do his/her best; does he/she work
						  calmly or become upset when thwarted? </li> 
						<li> Meeting Schedules, Attention To Detail, And Neatness In

						  his/her work? </li> 
						<li> Care With The Materials &amp; Property And Observance Of

						  to the guidelines established by the vocational evaluation staff.</li>

						<dd>The evaluee's Interests are tested with a minimum of two
						  interest tests. A Vocational Survey is used to assess attitudes towards
						  supervisors, peers, stressful working situations, and general work situations.
						  A Vocational Awareness test is given to assess the level of knowledge of
						  working situations.</dd> 
						<dt>Personal. Social. and Work Histories</dt>

						  assessment the evaluee is asked about his/her personal life, social life, and
						  his/her work history, this includes interactions with peers and
						  supervisors.</dd> 
						<dt>Work Skills and Work Tolerances</dt> 
						<dd>The evaluee will be assessed on his/her ability to
						  perform work activities which closely resemble actual vocational situations,
						  (i.e.. clerical work, bookkeeping, working with tools, drafting activities,
						  electronics assembly, and other assessment instruments as dictated by the
						  referral questions.) Work tolerance for an eight-hour day will be assessed
						  during the vocational evaluation of more than one day.</dd> 
						<dt>Job-Seeking-Skills</dt> 
						<dd>During an interview the evaluee's ability to relate to
						  interview type questions is assessed, a job application is given to each person
						  and is "graded" as to its acceptability to an employer, and vocational
						  awareness of various employment related questions is assessed.</dd>
